# Matter Megadrive fork

A fork of [jonab03/MatterMegadrive](https://github.com/jonab03/MatterMegadrive) which is a fork of [Ionaru/MatterMegadrive](https://github.com/Ionaru/MatterMegadrive) which is a large fork of the [original Matter Overdrive](https://github.com/simeonradivoev/MatterOverdrive/tree/1.7.10)

#### created at the request of [Darek505](https://github.com/Darek505)

### Changes:

1. Disabled the display of android parts on the player to avoid various bugs, for example with efr elytras

2. The balance of android abilities has been slightly changed (for the better), the cooldown of abilities has been reduced due to higher energy consumption (as far as I remember)

3. Fixed a large number of crashes related to the generation of structures (`java.lang.NullPointerException: Exception ticking world`)
