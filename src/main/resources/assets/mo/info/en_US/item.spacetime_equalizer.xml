        <text class="matter-text text-block">When dealing with [block name=gravitational_anomaly] there is only one item
            that can help you fight that gravitational pull.
            The Space-Time Equalizer negates the effects of the [block name=gravitational_anomaly] on the entity wearing
            it.
            The Equalizer can be warn on the Chest and provides the protection equivalent of iron armor.

        <text class="matter-text text-block">Although the equalizer is quite helpful with anomalies, it does slow the
            entity wearing it, down to a crawl.
