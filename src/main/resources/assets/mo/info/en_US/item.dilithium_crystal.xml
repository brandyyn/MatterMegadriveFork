        <text class="matter-text text-block" style="width:180px">Dilithium is an extremely hard crystalline mineral that
            occurs naturally on some planets.
            When placed in a high-frequency electromagnetic field, magnetic eddies are induced in its structure which
            keep charged particles away from the crystal lattice.
